      question: "Should I buy an IPO first day?",
      answer: "It depends on various factors including company fundamentals, market conditions, and your investment strategy.

      question: "What is issue size?",
      answer: "Issue size refers to the total amount of capital a company aims to raise through the IPO. It's calculated by multiplying the number of shares being offered by the price band. A larger issue size may indicate the company's capital requirements and growth plans."
    },
    {
      question: "How many shares in a lot?",
      answer: "The number of shares in a lot varies by IPO and is specified in the IPO prospectus. Typically, retail investors can apply for a minimum of one lot, and the lot size is determined to make the minimum investment amount reasonable for individual investors."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the lot size calculated?",
      answer: "Lot size is determined by the company in consultation with SEBI based on the share price and minimum investment amount. The goal is to keep the minimum investment accessible to retail investors while maintaining a reasonable number of shares per application."
    },
    {
      question: "Who decides the IPO price band?",
      answer: "The IPO price band is decided by the company in consultation with merchant bankers, underwriters, and market feedback during the book-building process. The final price is determined based on investor demand and market conditions during the IPO period."
    },
    {
      question: "What is IPO GMP?",
      answer: "GMP (Grey Market Premium) is the premium at which IPO shares are traded in the grey market before listing. It indicates market sentiment and expected listing price, though it's not always accurate. GMP can fluctuate based on market conditions and investor interest."
    },
    {
      question: "How many lots should I apply for IPO?",
      answer: "You can apply for multiple lots based on your investment capacity and the IPO's lot size restrictions. Retail investors are typically allowed up to a certain limit, while HNIs and institutions have different categories. Consider your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation before deciding the number of lots."
